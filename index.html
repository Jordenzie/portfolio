I was broke in many ways: physically, mentally, financially, emotionally, and spiritually. I was 19 years old. I painfully sat my way through the service as I was very anxious about everything in life at the time. After worship, I randomly had a picture of a $20 bill pop into my head...&#10;&#10;The night before was my first night back in Redding in a while. I recently quit my job, changed my major, moved back home, and desperately needed a fresh start. Before I went to bed that night, I wrestled deeply with the existence of God for the first time in my life and prayed that if He was real to save me...&#10;&#10;So there I was, in church, sitting cluelessly with a picture of a $20 bill in my head. Almost instantly, the lady sitting right next to me, who I had never seen before in my life, handed me a $20 bill and told me the Holy Spirit told her to give it to me. I never even got to say a word to her before she quickly got up and left with her family. I was completely shocked as if lightning went through my body, becoming totally aware in that moment that God is real and He was listening the whole time... I was and still am changed forever!">
