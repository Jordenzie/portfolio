I was still a believer but not really living like one to the best of my ability you could say...&#10;&#10;On January 20, 2019, I went to church for the first time in a long time. I was broke: physically, mentally, financially, emotionally, and spiritually. I was 19 years old. I painfully sat my way through church, being very anxious about everything in life. After the worship, I randomly had a picture of a $20 bill pop into my head. If you had asked me then, it was definitely the thing I wanted/needed most at the time...&#10;&#10;The night before was my first night back in Redding in a while. I recently quit my job, moved back home, changed my major, and needed a fresh start to say the least. Before I went to bed, I doubted God for the first time in my life, and basically prayed that if he was real to save me...&#10;&#10;So there I was, sitting cluelessly with a picture of a $20 bill in my head. Almost immediately, the lady sitting right next to me, who I had never seen before in my life, handed me a $20 bill and told me the Holy Spirit told her to give it to me. I never even got to say a word to that woman before she quickly got up and left with her family. I was changed forever!! BTW... If it happened to me, it could definitely happen to you!&#10;&#10;P.S. The Holy Spirit = Jesus Christ">
